# T21-Sentiment-Analysis
Code from Task 21 of My Data Science Course on Sentiment Analysis

This code checks this file > https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products

It you can then select the row number of any review and it will chekc the sentiment of teh sentence. 

*Part of the code analyses all the reviews in the review.text column. This was a part of the requirements but it takes 10-20 mins to run. I would suggest commenting out as noted in the code and runing without it.
